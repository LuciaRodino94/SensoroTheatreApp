# SensoroTheatreApp

My individual project for Pervasive systems exam (academic year 2017/2018) at Sapienza Università di Roma

This is an iOS app, using Sensoro beacon, made with Xcode.
    
In this project I use Xcode for programming the app in Objective-C

To use Sensoro you need to download the SDK -> [Sensoro iOS SDK](https://github.com/Sensoro/SDK-iOS)
